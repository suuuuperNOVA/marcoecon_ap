# # Crowding out

# When there is a recessionary gap, the government increases the government spending to make up the gap. They use the appropriate fiscal policy and runs a deficit. Then, they will need to borrow money. This will result in:
# - The demand for money shifts to the right and the interest rate increases;
# - The higher rates of interest induce consumers and businesses to borrow and spend less than before;
# - This decline in private investment shifts the AD back to its original position.

# Crowding out
# : The increase in interest rates and subsequent decline in spending that occur when the government borrows money to finance a deficit.
# : Expansionary fiscal policy can be ineffectual.
