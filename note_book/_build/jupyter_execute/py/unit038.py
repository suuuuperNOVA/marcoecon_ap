# # Fiscal Policy

# Fiscal policy
# : Change the level of government spending or tax revenues to achieve economic stability.<br><br>
# 
# Expansionary fiscal policy
# : Increase government spending and/or decrease tax collections in order to stimulate the macroeconomy.
# : Shift AD to the right.
# : Remedy a recession.<br><br>
# 
# Contractionary fiscal policy
# : Decrease government spending and/or increase tax collections in order to cool off the economy and lower the price level.
# : Shift AD to the left.

# ## Long-Run Adjustment to a Recession Gap

# Without the fiscal policy, LRAS can correct the recessionary gap in the **long run** as shown in the figure below:
# - When the economy is operating at E1, the unemployment rate is high. So, the unemployed workers and idle resources put downward pressure on wages and other production costs.
# - When the resource prices fall, firms will increase the production, shifting SRAS to the right.
# - The price level will fall and real GDP will increase.
# - The economy will operate at a point on LRAS.

# ## Long-Run Adjustment to a Inflationary Gap

# Without the fiscal policy, LRAS can correct the inflationary gap in the **long run** as shown in the figure below:
# - When the economy is operating at E1, the unemployment rate is low. So, shortage in labor forces and resources put upward pressure on wages and other production costs.
# - When the resource prices increase, firms will decrease the production, shifting SRAS to the left.
# - The price level will increase and real GDP will decrease.
# - The economy will operate at a point on LRAS.

# ## Expansionary Fiscal Policy
# 
# The government increases spending or reduces tax collections, shifting AD to the right. The economy will operate at the point on LRAS. 
# 
# However, an expansionary fiscal policy has drawbacks:
# - Cause inflation;
# - Cause budget deficit.

# ## Contractionary Fiscal Policy
# 
# 

# The government decreases spending or increases tax collections, shifting AD to the left. The economy will operate at the point on LRAS. The government budget will tend toward a surplus.

# ## Fiscal Policy in Practice

# There are lags to discretionary fiscal policy because of factors such as the time it takes to decide on and implement a policy action.
