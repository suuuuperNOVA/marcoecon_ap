# # Nominal vs. Real Interest Rate

# Nominal interest rate
# : Percentage increase in money that the borrower pays (not adjusted for inflation).
# <br>
# 
# Real interest rate
# : Percentage increase in purchasing power that a borrower pays (adjusted for inflation).
# <br><br>
# **Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation rate**

# Example<br>
# If the nominal interest rate is 10% and the inflation rate is 15%, how much is the real interest rate?<br><br>
# Real interest rate = 10% - 15% = -5%. So, the lender is losing purchasing power in this case.
