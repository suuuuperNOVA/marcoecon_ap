# where M is the money supply (M1 or M2); V is the velocity of money; P is the price level; Y is the quantity of output or real GDP.

# Velocity of money
# : # of times the typical dollar of M1 or M2 is used to make purchases during a year.

# > We assume the velocity of money (v) and the real GDP are constant. The increase in the money supply (M) makes the inflation.

# - When the economy is at full employment, changes in the money supply have no effect on real output in the long run.
# - In the long run, the growth rate of the money supply determines the growth rate of the price level (inflation rate) according to the quantity theory of money.
