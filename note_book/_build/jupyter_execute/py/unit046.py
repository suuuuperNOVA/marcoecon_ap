# # Monetary Policy

# The money supply can **only** be changed by the Fed. The Fed changes the amount of money in the economy in 3 ways:
# - Reserve requirement ratio
#     - For a higher reserve requirement ratio, banks can hold more money and have less excess reserve;
#     - For a lower reserve requirement ratio, banks can hold less money and have more excess reserve.
# - Discount rate<br>The interest rate at which the Fed charges commercial banks.
#     - More money supply at a lower discount rate;
#     - Less money supply at a higher discount rate.
# - Public market operation
#     - More money supply when the Fed buys government bonds;
#     - Less money supply when the Fed sells government bonds.

# - The Fed changes the money supply to achieve macroeconomic goals, such as price stability and full employment.
# - In reality, there are lags to monetary policy caused by the time it takes to recognize a problem in the economy and the time it takes the economy to adjust to the policy action.
