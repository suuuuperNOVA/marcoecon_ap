# # The Loanable Funds Market

# > We still use demand and supply model to explain the loanable funds market.

# Financial intermediation is to get funds from lenders to borrowers. The interaction of borrowers, who demand loanable funds, and savers, who supply loanable funds, determines the equilibrium real interest rate.

# Who demands loans?
# - Individuals
# - Business
# - Governments
# - Foreign businesses and governments.

# ## Demand for Loanable Funds**
# 
# When the real interest rate is high, the quantity of funds demanded will be relatively low because of the high cost (*vice versa*). So, the demand curve is downward sloping.

# ### Investing and Demand
# 
# Borrowing is the demand of loanable funds, including private investment and government borrowing.<br>
# 
# Private investment
# : Borrowing by businesses and consumers.<br>
# 
# Government borrowing
# : Deficit spending when government spending is greater than tax revenue.

# ## Supply for Loanable Funds
# 
# When the real interest rate is high, the quantity of funds supplied will be relatively high because of the high interest (*vice versa*). So, the supply curve is upward sloping.

# ### Saving and Supply
# 
# Saving is what makes lending possible so the supply of loanable funds is the amount of money that is saved.<br>
# 
# Private saving
# : Amount that households save instead of consume.<br>
# 
# Public saving
# : Amount that the government saves instead of spends.<br>
# 
# ```{note}
# For a **closed** economy, **National savings = Public saving + Private saving**.<br><br>
# 
# For an *open* economy, **Investment = National savings + Net capital inflow**.
# ```
