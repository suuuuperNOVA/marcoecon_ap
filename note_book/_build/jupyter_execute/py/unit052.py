# # The Phillips Curve

# The Phillips curve model is used to represent the relationship between inflation and unemployment and to illustrate how macroeconomic shocks affect inflation and unemployment.

# ```{admonition} Relationship between inflation and unemployment
# Inflation and unemployment move in opposite directions.
# - The higher the inflation rate, the lower the unemployment rate.
# - The lower the inflation rate, the higher the unemployment rate.<br><br>
# 
# The figure below shows the Phillips curve, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

# ## Effects of AD Shifts

# - If AD shifts right, the economy slides up the **short-run** Phillips curve.
# - If AD shifts left, the economy slides down the **short-run** Phillips curve.

# - In the long run, the shift of AD does not change the **long-run** Phillips curve, which is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment.
# - Factors that cause the natural rate of unemployment to change will cause the LRPC to shift.
# - Points to the left of long-run equilibrium represent inflationary gaps, while points to the right of long-run equilibrium represent recessionary gaps.

# ## Effects of SRAS Shifts

# - If SRAS shifts left, the **short-run** Phillips curve shifts right.
# - If SRAS shifts right, the **short-run** Phillips curve shifts left.
