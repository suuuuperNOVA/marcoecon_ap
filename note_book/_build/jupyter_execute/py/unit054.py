# # Government Deficits and the National Debt

# Budget deficit
# : When annual government spending and transfer payments are greater than tax revenue.<br>
# 
# Budget surplus
# : When annual government spending and transfer payments are less than tax revenue.<br>
# 
# National debt
# : Accumulation of all the budget deficits over time. 
# : If the Government increases spending without increasing taxes they will increase the annual deficit and the national debt. 

# A government must pay interest on its accumulated debt, thus increasing the national debt and increasingly forgoing using those funds for alternative uses.
