# # The Money Market

# > The supply and demand for money make up the money market.
# 
# Money market model:
# - Nominal interest rate is the y-axis,
# - Quantity of money is the x-axis.

# ## Demand of Money

# The demand of money is downward sloping.
# - Higher interest rate, lower money in hand;
# - Lower interest rate,  more money in hand.
# 
# ### Shifts of Demand of Money
# 
# - A change in income<br>A higher income, more money to spend. The money demand curve shifts to the right.
# - A change in the price level<br>A higher price level, more money needed. The money demand curve shifts to the right.

# As shown in the figure below, an increase in the demand for money will increase the interest rate.

# ## Supply of Money

# The supply of money is vertical because it is set by the Fed and independent from the interest rate.

# As shown in the figure below, an increase in the money supply will decrease the interest rate.

# Disequilibrium nominal interest rates create surpluses and shortages in the money market. Market forces drive nominal interest rates toward equilibrium.
