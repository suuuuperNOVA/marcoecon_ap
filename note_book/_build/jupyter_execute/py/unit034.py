# # Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)

# In the long run, wages and resource prices are flexible and will change when price level changes.

# ```{admonition} Example
# If a firm currently makes 100 units that are sold for \$1 each, the only cost is \$80 of labor. The total profit is \$20.<br><br>
# In a short run, the product price is doubled. The total profit becomes \$120. So, the firms have an incentive to make more.<br><br>
# But in a long run, workers demand higher wages to match higher price level. Then, the labor costs double to \$160. The total profit becomes \$40. The firms have no incentive to produce more since real profit is the same.
# ```

# As shown in the figure below, in the long run:
# - Price level increases but **real GDP doesn't**.
# - Economy produces at full employment (points on the PPC), which is known as **maximum sustainable capacity**.

# ## Shifters in LRAS
# 
# - Change in resource quantity or quality
# - Change in technology
