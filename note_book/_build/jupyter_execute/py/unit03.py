# # National Income and Price Determination

# ```{note}
# Similar to microeconomics, we still use demand-supply model to represent the relationship between price and quantity. However, in macroeconomics, we have some changes in terms:
# 
# 
# |Microeconomics|Macroeconomics|
# |:---:|:---:|
# |Demand|Aggregate demand|
# |Supply|Aggregate supply|
# |Price|Price level|
# |Quantity|Output|
# 
# 
# **Aggregate** means to add all together. In macroeconomics, we study total demand and supply in a country rather than a single goods or service.
