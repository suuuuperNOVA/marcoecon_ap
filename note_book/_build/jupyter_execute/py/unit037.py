# # Long-Run Self-Adjustment

# > In the long run, in the absence of government policy actions, flexible wages and prices will adjust to restore full employment and unemployment will revert to its natural rate after a shock to aggregate demand or short-run aggregate supply.

# ## Demand-Pull Inflation

# The figure below shows a **long-run increase in AD**:
# - If there is an increase in AD, the short-run equilibrium point will move from the yellow point to the red one;
# - The red point is right to LRAS, meaning that the unemployment rate is lower than the natural unemployment rate (out of PPC);
# - Meanwhile, the price level increases from PLe to PL1.
# - In the long run, wages and costs increase;
# - SRAS shifts to SRAS1, reaching a new long-run equilibrium point (white);
# - At the white point, the unemployment rate equals NUR (on PPC).

# LRAS is unchanged and the real GDP is also unchanged, but the price level increases. This is a cause of inflation.

# ## Decrease in AD

# The figure below shows a recession caused by a long-run decrease in AD:
# - If there is a decrease in AD, the equilibrium point moves from Ef to E2;
# - Real GDP decreases from Yf to Y2;
# - The price level decreases from Pf to P2;
# - The decrease in price level makes the resource cost decrease and shifts SRAS to the right;
# - Finally, reaching a new long-run equilibrium point E3.

# ## Economic Growth

# Economic growth can be obtained by:
# - More resources
# - Technological enhancement.
# 
# Either of these occurrences shifts both LRAS and SRAS to the right. Meanwhile, the PPC shifts outward.
