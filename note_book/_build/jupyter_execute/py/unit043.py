# - M1<br>Narrow money, including M0 and other highly liquid deposits in the bank.<br>M1 = M0 + Checking account
#     - Currency in circulation
#     - Checkable bank deposits (checking account)
# - M2<br>M2 = M1 + Saving account + Other less liquid bank deposits
#     - Saving account
#     - Small time deposits (certificates of deposit)
#     - Money market funds

# M1 and M2 money often earn little to no interest so the opportunity cost of holding liquid money is the interest you could be earning.
