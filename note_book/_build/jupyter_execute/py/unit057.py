# # Public Policy and Economic Growth

# Policies resulting in the long-run economic growth:
# - Education/Training spending<br>Increase human capital.
# - Infrastructure spending<br>Increase physical capital.
# - Production/Investment incentive programs<br>Increase physical capital by reducing tax rate.

# Government spending does not necessarily results in economic growth. Only spending that **increases productivity or technology** does.
